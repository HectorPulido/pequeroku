# PequeRoku Dashboard (Vue + TypeScript)

This package contains the Vue 3 + TypeScript rewrite of the PequeRoku dashboard that mirrors the behaviour of the legacy static frontend found in `source/front`.

## Available scripts

```bash
npm install   # install dependencies
npm run dev   # start the Vite dev server
npm run build # type-check and build for production
npm run preview # preview the production build locally
```

By default the application is built assuming it is served under the `/dashboard/` base path, matching the legacy deployment.
